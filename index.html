When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a powered suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true identity, Stark eventually declared that he was, in fact, Iron Man in a public announcement.</p>

When his irresponsible behavior restarted a conflict between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power, and banished by his father Odin to Earth. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane Foster, and helping to save his new friends from a destructive threat sent by his adoptive brother Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice, Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat Loki's schemes of genocide.</p>

Born within Brooklyn, New York City, the young Rogers had suffered from numerous health problems, and upon America's entry into World War II, was rejected from military service despite several attempts to enlist. Determined to serve, he ultimately volunteered for the top-secret Super Soldier program, and the frail Rogers was then enhanced to the peak of human perfection. Rogers soon joined the war effort as the mascot, given the new moniker of Captain America, and later joined the war with a combat role after he single-handedly liberated captured Allied POWs.</p>
